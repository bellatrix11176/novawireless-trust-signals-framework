TRUST SIGNAL HEALTH — SUMMARY REPORT
========================================
Rows analyzed: 10000

OVERALL RATES
- CBR (callback rate): 45.5%
- CDS (cleanup rate): 55.1%
- 30DACC rate: 19.0%
- POR (port-out rate): 8.9%
- Repeat contact rate: 60.3%
- Avg drift_score: 0.4
- CRT avg (seconds): 804.2
- CRT p90 (seconds): 1048.8
- CRT > 900s rate: 30.2%
- CRT risk avg (scaled 480–900s): 0.687

CRT INTERPRETATION
- CRT is treated as a friction cost signal (higher is worse).
- CRT risk is scaled: <= 480s → 0, >= 900s → 1.

DRIFT CONCENTRATION (where risk clusters)
- Top 10% of calls account for: 19.9% of total drift_score
- Top 10% of customers account for: 80.1% of total drift_score (proxy)

INTERPRETATION HINTS
- Headline KPIs can look stable while drift indicators rise (30DACC/port-outs/repeats/CRT).
- Cleanup isn’t failure; it’s often proof you’re fixing upstream mistakes (or catching bad inputs).
- CRT is a cost signal: even if outcomes are stable, rising CRT suggests growing friction/complexity.
- Concentration tells you whether to fix hotspots or address broad process issues.
